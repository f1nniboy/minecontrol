# Installation
Installing Minecontrol is very easy. Follow the steps below to install it.

## Prerequisites

## The "git" way
We assume that you installed `node`, `git` and `typescript` correctly.

**2.** Clone this repository into any folder by typing `git clone https://github.com/f1nniboy/minecontrol`.

**3.** When the cloning is done, go into the directory by typing `cd minecontrol`.

**4.** Install all the packages by typing `npm install` into your terminal.

**3.** If everything worked, you should be able to type `npm run start` to build the project and run it.

## The "npm" way
We assume that you installed `node` and `typescript` correctly.

**1.** Open a terminal of your choice *as an administrator / sudo* (e. g. `cmd` if you're on Windows, or any terminal if you're on Linux / macOS)

**2.** Install the `minecontrol` package by typing `npm install minecontrol -g`.

**3.** When you installed it, type `minecontrol` in your terminal.

**4.** If everything worked, you should now be able to use **Minecontrol**.

# Can I get banned on servers using this?
Server owners or anticheats **can't** detect bots, unless you use a spammer or any other obvious botting tool.
